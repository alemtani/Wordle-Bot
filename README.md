# Wordle Bot
Wordle, except with the additional feature of letting a bot choose your words.

## How to Play

Guess the five letter word in six attempts. The word will be randomly generated on every round. Additionally, you can run the bot to have a bot guess a word for you (relies on information theory). Or you can reset the game and try a new word.

To pause and unpause the game, press Space.
